# finger_flexion_motion
An algorithm for predicting finger flexion motion captured by a data glove from ECoG data.

The goal of this project is to predict finger flexion motion captured by the data glove based on subject ECoG data records. The algorithm pre-processes the data by first removing noisy channels, filtering the data, and subtracting constant noise. It then extracts 6 unique features from each channel for every subjectâ€™s dataset. The first feature is average time domain signal voltage, and the subsequent five features were the average frequency domain voltage of five different frequency bands determined from consulting literature. A linear decoder was used to create a model for the four fingers with a specific linear filter for each finger. The predicted finger angles were zero clamped and smoothed, and initial predictions were spline interpolated to match the dimensions of the provided finger angles. Methods to develop this algorithm were influenced by published literature, past engineering competitions, and guidance provided by course instructors. Decisions made throughout the process were motivated by trial and error and cross-validation. These predictions achieved a maximum correlation of 0.5072 with the averaged correlations of all four fingers when compared to unseen testing data.
